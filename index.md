# 2020.10.22 - First!

In all seriousness, this is my first post at running a blog again. This blog will contain information about personal projects, things that interest me. Come back occasionally for new posts.

I recently put up [some scripts](https://github.com/khorwood/arch-wsl-rootfs) which will adapt the ArchLinux bootstrap image to a rootfs compatible with importing as a distro for WSL. I've also posted a release with a prebuilt rootfs bundle if anyone wants to save time building one.
